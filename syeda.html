                <p>Having leadership qualities and have good communication skills. Seeking more experience from team leads and continuing to develop strategies to grow </p>
                
                <p>My work experience as a Project Engineer at Wipro, starting from October 11, 
                    2021, demonstrates a comprehensive background in SAP Hybris development 
                    and website monitoring. Over the course of my two years at Wipro, i have worked 
                    on prominent accounts, including Apple and Walmart, and is currently engaged 
                    with the Whirlpool account.</p>
                <p> As a Hybris developer, I have acquired foundational knowledge in SAP Hybris, 
                    an e-commerce platform widely used for building online stores and managing 
                    digital commerce solutions. My experience with major clients like Apple and 
                    Walmart suggests that I was involved in developing and maintaining solutions 
                    tailored to their specific needs.</p>
                <p> In my current role, working with the Whirlpool account, I am engaged in 24/7 
                    monitoring of websites. This continuous monitoring is crucial for ensuring the 
                    optimal performance, availability, and reliability of the web applications I support. 
                    Additionally, I like to mention that I monitor Dynatrace alerts, indicating a 
                    proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential issues before they 
                    impact the user experience.</p>
                <p> A significant aspect of my role involves solving tasks and bugs, with a specific 
                    focus on front-end issues. This suggests that I have hands-on in addressing user 
                    interface-related challenges, contributing to the overall quality and functionality of 
                    the web applications.</p>
                <p> My experience reflects a well-rounded skill set that includes SAP Hybris 
                    development, real-time web monitoring, and troubleshooting on the front end. 
                    These skills are essential in the dynamic field of IT and contribute to the 
                    successful execution and maintenance of complex projects.</p>
